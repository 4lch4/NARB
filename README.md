Not Another Reminder Bot is, well, another reminder bot. It's a Discord bot that lets you schedule reminders in intervals, on a set schedule, etc.

The initial version(s) will be all free, but I will eventually add a premium option for things like recurring reminders that will be paid features. If you use the bot before premium becomes a thing, you will be "grandfathered" into the premium option for free.
